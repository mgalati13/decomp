read problem </ORDATA/miplib/forint.mps>
============

original problem has 475 variables (0 bin, 380 int, 0 impl, 95 cont) and 99 constraints
presolving:
(round 1, fast)       95 del vars, 95 del conss, 95 add conss, 570 chg bounds, 0 chg sides, 0 chg coeffs, 0 upgd conss, 0 impls, 0 clqs
(round 2, fast)       99 del vars, 189 del conss, 95 add conss, 570 chg bounds, 1 chg sides, 0 chg coeffs, 0 upgd conss, 0 impls, 0 clqs
(round 3, fast)       99 del vars, 189 del conss, 95 add conss, 570 chg bounds, 5 chg sides, 0 chg coeffs, 0 upgd conss, 0 impls, 0 clqs
presolving (4 rounds: 4 fast, 1 medium, 1 exhaustive):
 475 deleted vars, 194 deleted constraints, 95 added constraints, 570 tightened bounds, 0 added holes, 5 changed sides, 0 changed coefficients
 0 implications, 0 cliques
presolved problem has 0 variables (0 bin, 0 int, 0 impl, 0 cont) and 0 constraints
transformed objective value is always integral (scale: 1)
Presolving Time: 0.00
No problem exists, cannot detect structure!
No decomposition exists or could be detected. You need to specify one.
