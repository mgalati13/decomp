created seeedpool for current problem, n detectors: 26 
 Consclassifier "nonzeros" yields a classification with 79  different constraint classes 
 Consclassifier "constypes" yields a classification with 2 different constraint classes 
 Consclassifier "constypes according to miplib" yields a classification with 2 different constraint classes 
 Consclassifier "constypes according to miplib" is not considered since it offers the same structure as "constypes" consclassifier
 Varclassifier "vartypes" yields a classification with 1 different variable classes
 Varclassifier "varobjvals" yields a classification with 7 different variable classes
 Varclassifier "varobjvalsigns" yields a classification with 2 different variable classes
 Added reduced version of varclassifier varobjvals with 5 different variable classes
 the current consclass distribution includes 79 classes but only 18 are allowed for calcCandidatesNBlocks()
Begin of detection round 0 of 1 total rounds 
Start to propagate seeed with id 1 (0 of 1 in round 0) 
 in dec_consclass: there are 2 different constraint classes   
 the current consclass distribution includes 79 classes but only 5 are allowed for propagateSeeed() of cons class detector
  the current constraint classifier "constypes" consists of 2 different classes   
 dec_consclass found 3 new seeeds 
dec_densemasterconss found 1 new seeed 
 the current varclass distribution includes 7 classes but only 5 are allowed for propagateSeeed() of var class detector
Start finishing of partial decomposition 1.
