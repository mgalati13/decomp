Chosen structure has 83 blocks, 61 linking variables, and 0 linking constraints.
This decomposition has a maxwhite score of 0.622985.
Warning: Discretization with continuous variables is only an experimental feature.
Big M to be used for artificial variables not reliable; use regular Farkas pricing instead.
