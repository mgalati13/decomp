============

original problem has 283023 variables (282492 bin, 0 int, 0 impl, 531 cont) and 564986 constraints
presolving:
(round 1, exhaustive) 0 del vars, 141246 del conss, 0 add conss, 0 chg bounds, 0 chg sides, 0 chg coeffs, 0 upgd conss, 0 impls, 142310 clqs

   (13.3s) probing: 51/282492 (0.0%) - 0 fixings, 0 aggregations, 0 implications, 0 bound changes
   (13.3s) probing aborted: 50/50 successive totally useless probings
presolving (3 rounds: 3 fast, 3 medium, 3 exhaustive):
 0 deleted vars, 141246 deleted constraints, 0 added constraints, 0 tightened bounds, 0 added holes, 0 changed sides, 0 changed coefficients
 0 implications, 142310 cliques
presolved problem has 283023 variables (282492 bin, 0 int, 0 impl, 531 cont) and 423740 constraints
 142310 constraints of type <setppc>
 281430 constraints of type <linear>
transformed objective value is always integral (scale: 1)

start creating seeedpool for current problem 
created seeedpool for current problem, n detectors: 26 
 Consclassifier "nonzeros" yields a classification with 3  different constraint classes 
 Consclassifier "constypes" yields a classification with 3 different constraint classes 
 Consclassifier "constypes" is not considered since it offers the same structure as "nonzeros" consclassifier
 Consclassifier "constypes according to miplib" yields a classification with 3 different constraint classes 
 Consclassifier "constypes according to miplib" is not considered since it offers the same structure as "nonzeros" consclassifier
 Varclassifier "vartypes" yields a classification with 2 different variable classes
 Varclassifier "varobjvals" yields a classification with 2727 different variable classes
 Varclassifier "varobjvalsigns" yields a classification with 2 different variable classes
 Varclassifier "varobjvalsigns" is not considered since it offers the same structure as "vartypes"
 the current varclass distribution includes 2727 classes but only 18 are allowed for calcCandidatesNBlocks()
Begin of detection round 0 of 1 total rounds 
Start to propagate seeed with id 1 (0 of 1 in round 0) 
 in dec_consclass: there are 1 different constraint classes   
  the current constraint classifier "nonzeros" consists of 3 different classes   
 dec_consclass found 7 new seeeds 
dec_densemasterconss found 1 new seeed 
 the current varclass distribution includes 2727 classes but only 5 are allowed for propagateSeeed() of var class detector
Start finishing of partial decomposition 1.
