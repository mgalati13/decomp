start creating seeedpool for current problem 
created seeedpool for current problem, n detectors: 26 
 Consclassifier "nonzeros" yields a classification with 516  different constraint classes 
 Consclassifier "constypes" yields a classification with 4 different constraint classes 
 Consclassifier "constypes according to miplib" yields a classification with 5 different constraint classes 
 Varclassifier "vartypes" yields a classification with 1 different variable classes
 Varclassifier "varobjvals" yields a classification with 2 different variable classes
 Varclassifier "varobjvalsigns" yields a classification with 1 different variable classes
 Varclassifier "varobjvalsigns" is not considered since it offers the same structure as "vartypes"
 the current consclass distribution includes 516 classes but only 18 are allowed for calcCandidatesNBlocks()
