start creating seeedpool for current problem 
created seeedpool for current problem, n detectors: 26 
 Consclassifier "nonzeros" yields a classification with 451  different constraint classes 
 Consclassifier "constypes" yields a classification with 4 different constraint classes 
 Consclassifier "constypes according to miplib" yields a classification with 5 different constraint classes 
 Varclassifier "vartypes" yields a classification with 1 different variable classes
 Varclassifier "varobjvals" yields a classification with 2 different variable classes
 Varclassifier "varobjvalsigns" yields a classification with 1 different variable classes
 Varclassifier "varobjvalsigns" is not considered since it offers the same structure as "vartypes"
 the current consclass distribution includes 451 classes but only 18 are allowed for calcCandidatesNBlocks()

 in dec_consclass: there are 3 different constraint classes   
 the current consclass distribution includes 451 classes but only 5 are allowed for propagateSeeed() of cons class detector
  the current constraint classifier "constypes" consists of 4 different classes   
  the current constraint classifier "constypes according to miplib" consists of 5 different classes
