 Consclassifier "nonzeros" yields a classification with 508  different constraint classes 
 Consclassifier "constypes" yields a classification with 6 different constraint classes 
 Consclassifier "constypes according to miplib" yields a classification with 10 different constraint classes 
 Varclassifier "vartypes" yields a classification with 3 different variable classes
 Varclassifier "varobjvals" yields a classification with 198 different variable classes
 Varclassifier "varobjvalsigns" yields a classification with 3 different variable classes
 Added reduced version of consclassifier constypes with 5  different constraint classes 
 the current consclass distribution includes 508 classes but only 18 are allowed for calcCandidatesNBlocks()
 the current varclass distribution includes 198 classes but only 18 are allowed for calcCandidatesNBlocks()
Begin of detection round 0 of 1 total rounds 
Start to propagate seeed with id 1 (0 of 1 in round 0) 
 in dec_consclass: there are 4 different constraint classes   
 the current consclass distribution includes 508 classes but only 5 are allowed for propagateSeeed() of cons class detector
 the current consclass distribution includes 6 classes but only 5 are allowed for propagateSeeed() of cons class detector
 the current consclass distribution includes 10 classes but only 5 are allowed for propagateSeeed() of cons class detector
  the current constraint classifier "constypes-red-to-5" consists of 5 different classes   
 dec_consclass found 31 new seeeds 
dec_densemasterconss found 1 new seeed 
 the current varclass distribution includes 198 classes but only 5 are allowed for propagateSeeed() of var class detector
Start finishing of partial decomposition 1.
