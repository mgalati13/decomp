Chosen structure has 17 blocks and 18 linking constraints.
This decomposition has a maxwhite score of 0.930632.
Warning: Discretization with continuous variables is only an experimental feature.
Matrix has 17 blocks, using 17 pricing problems.
Big M to be used for artificial variables not reliable; use regular Farkas pricing instead.
