(1) Need a newer cmake than what is installed on orgrd. I have a local one in ~/cmake/.

(2) To build SCIP - in /ORDATA/SCIP/scipoptsuite-6.0.0
 - plus I needed a patch for the build:
 http://scip.zib.de/download/bugfixes/scip-6.0.0/scipoptsuite-6.0.0_patch01.tgz

(3) GCC on orgrd is also too old, but we can point to a newer one mounted here:
export CC=/sas3rd/dev/mva-vb015/lax/gcc/gcc-4.9.4/bin/gcc 
export CXX=/sas3rd/dev/mva-vb015/lax/gcc/gcc-4.9.4/bin/g++ 
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/sas3rd/dev/mva-vb015/lax/gcc/gcc-4.9.4/lib:/sas3rd/dev/mva-vb015/lax/gcc/gcc-4.9.4/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

(4) In cmake, point to BLISS (must be a sym-link) and HMETIS executable (must be older version 1.5):
 /r/sanyo.unx.sas.com/vol/vol420/u42/magala/cmake/bin/bin/cmake .. -DBLISS_DIR=/LOG_DATA/bliss-0.73/bliss -DHMETIS_EXECUTABLE=/LOG_DATA/hMetis/hmetis-1.5-linux/hmetis

(5) Added a wrapper to get GCGTIME= in gcg/src/main.c
  
(6) Added a message in gcg/src/dec_hrgpartition.cpp to print out the hmetiscall info (for debugging).

(7) For some reason, even though HMETIS was included in cmake, the GCG Makefile has it set to false. 
So, I changed it to true.

(7) make
